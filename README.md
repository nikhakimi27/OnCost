## Introduction

OnCost is created to help to calculate the built-up-rate for wall and roof.

## Project Status

This project is currently available for download. Users can calculate built-up-rate for walls and roofs. Functionality to share calculations made is in progress.

## Reflection

This application was developed for Group 2 under subject 'Construction Information Technology' (2021/2022) under Assoc. Prof. Sr. Dr. Kherun Nita Binti Ali. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with React Native for new features.  

A friend of mine approached me to build a mobile application for his group assignment (given that the coordinator allowed the project to be outsourced). Raw materials such as calculation formulas, interface designs, and project proposals were prepared by the group members for me to develop the app.

This project is a simple app development with minimal skill requirements. I took the opportunity to try and create a responsive interface as I did not consider on making my application responsive in my previous project.

Also, I had some trouble getting the correct calculations. After countless of double checks, I found out that integers and floats are crucial when doing calculations. Other than that, the development process was pretty much smooth.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React Native, Visual Studio, Adobe Illustrator (for graphics) and Adobe Photoshop.
